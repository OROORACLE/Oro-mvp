# ORO - Onchain Reputation Oracle

## üéØ What is ORO?

ORO analyzes onchain behavior patterns to create portable reputation scores that help DeFi protocols make better risk decisions and reward trusted users.

**The Problem:** DeFi protocols lack reliable reputation data, leading to:
- Higher risk and fraud
- Poor user experience
- Fragmented reputation across protocols

**The Solution:** ORO provides:
- Dynamic reputation scores (0-100) for any wallet
- Zero-gas JWT attestations (30-day portable credentials)
- Simple API for easy protocol integration

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Score Generation
- **Real onchain analysis** of wallet behavior patterns
- **Multi-factor scoring algorithm** (0-100) analyzing:
  - Transaction patterns and activity levels
  - DeFi protocol interactions and usage
  - Wallet age and historical behavior
  - Token diversity and portfolio composition
  - Balance and financial activity
- **Updates in real-time** as behavior changes

### 2. Risk Analysis & Fraud Detection
- **Advanced pattern recognition** to identify suspicious behavior
- **OFAC compliance** with sanctioned address detection
- **Bot and wash trading detection** through behavioral analysis
- **Multi-layered risk assessment** with real-time flagging
- **Comprehensive risk scoring** for informed decision making

### 3. JWT Attestations
- Zero-gas portable credentials (30-day validity)
- EIP-712 signatures for Web3 compatibility
- Partners can cache and reuse attestations

### 4. Protocol Integration
- Simple REST API
- Real-time score lookup
- Easy integration with existing contracts
